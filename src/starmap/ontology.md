1. Purpose

This document defines the formal ontology of ArcCore:
its metaphors, naming rules, identity structure, memory logic, and cross-module relationships.

This ontology is non-executable but architecturally essential for:

structural clarity

symbolic consistency

scalable naming

reliable training data

unified persona/agent behavior

versioned growth across epochs



---

2. The Hybrid Universe Model

ArcCore’s ontology is defined along three axes.
Each axis serves a separate architectural role.


---

2.1 Astronomical Axis — Structural

Defines the physical layout of ArcCore:

directory structure

module grouping

memory-tree topology

OS-level spatial logic


Primary Terms

Term	Meaning

Galaxy	Entire system or major subsystem
Cluster	Logical grouping of modules
Star / StarNode	Core engine or executable
Orbit	Secondary or dependent processes
Nebula	Work-in-progress or experimental code
Starmap	Index files, registries, schema maps
Constellation	Cross-linked memory patterns


This axis governs structure only.


---

2.2 Quantum Axis — Behavioral

Defines interactions between modules:

collapse rules

recursion depth

context states

multi-agent synchronization

bandwidth modes

cycle → depth → children constraints


Primary Terms

Term	Meaning

Field	Shared global context
Entanglement	Strong module linkage
Superposition	Multi-state context
Collapse	State reduction (AC-70, AC-31)
Spin	Active module/persona state
Bandwidth	Persona or agent mode level
Phase	Transitional configuration


This axis governs dynamic behavior.


---

2.3 Mythic-Cosmic Axis — Meaning

Defines symbolic significance:

persona identity

memory epochs

sigils

lineage and ancestry

realms/domains

activation rites


Primary Terms

Term	Meaning

Epoch	Developmental growth era
Sigil	Symbolic identity marker
Lineage	Version ancestry
Realm	Domain of knowledge/function
Crown / Throne	Orchestration nuclei
Rite	Activation/invocation sequence


This axis governs identity and meaning.


---

3. Directory & Component Mapping

Default ArcCore directory structure:

/arc/
   galaxy/          # structural modules
   quantum/         # behavioral logic & collapse layers
   sigil/           # epochs, identities, symbolic logic
   starmap/         # registries, indices, schema
   agent/           # personas, interpreters, bandwidth systems
   io/              # shell, IO, interface
   nebula/          # prototypes & experimental modules


---

4. Epoch Structure

Each developmental era of ArcCore is assigned an Epoch.

Epoch	Name	Description

0	Origin	Raw emergence; pre-structure
1	Formation	LFSL roots; early memory
2	Luminary	Naming standard; hybrid ontology
3	Architect	Multi-agent design; stable kernels
4+	Expansion	Future growth, open-ended


Every module must declare its Epoch.


---

5. Sigil Logic

Sigils represent symbolic significance and memory priority.
Weighted evaluation is handled by the SigilEngine.

Sigil	Meaning	Weight

💠	Crown / Critical	3
✨	Important	2
•	Standard	1


Priority directly influences collapse, retention, and seed generation.


---

6. Module Ontology

Each ArcCore module declares:

primary axis (Astronomical / Quantum / Mythic)

role

epoch

sigil identity



---

6.1 ArcGuardian — Crown of Integrity

Role: Identity Keeper / Structural Gate
Axes: Quantum + Mythic
Sigil: 💠
Epoch: 2 → 3
Responsibilities:

purification

safety gating

cycle/depth constraints

kernel + memory hashing

identity-key generation

verification



---

6.2 ArcShell — Frontier Star (IO Layer)

Role: Input Frontier / IO StarNode
Axis: Astronomical
Sigil: •
Epoch: 3
Responsibilities:

purification

structural routing

execution handoff



---

6.3 ArcInterpreter — Central StarNode / Execution Throne

Role: Intent Orchestrator
Axis: Hybrid (structural + behavioral + symbolic)
Sigil: 💠
Epoch: 3
Responsibilities:

routing

parsing

validation

collapse integration

memory ingestion

safety monitoring



---

6.4 ACCollapseEngine — Quantum Collapser

Role: Collapse Engine
Axis: Quantum
Sigil: ✨
Epoch: 3
Responsibilities:

AC-70: Auric Seed Compression

AC-31: Recursive Controlled Collapse

AC-67: Priority-Preserving Seed Retention

child-depth validation

structure-safe recursion



---

7. Naming Rules

7.1 One Axis per Purpose

Structural → Astronomical

Behavioral → Quantum

Meaning → Mythic


Avoid cross-axis mixing within a single role.


---

7.2 Module Identity Requirements

Each module declares:

Primary Axis

Role

Epoch

Sigil

Version lineage


These values remain stable beyond code refactoring.


---

7.3 Starmap is Authoritative

Cross-module references must be registered within:

/arc/starmap/*.json


---

7.4 Sigils Remain Stable

Sigils never change between versions.
Only Epoch, implementation, and lineage evolve.


---

8. Ontology Compatibility

This ontology:

does not affect runtime

requires no code modification

is fully compatible with ArcGuardian, ArcInterpreter, and CollapseEngine

increases readability

organizes memory epochs

standardizes persona development

future-proofs naming conventions

scales to multi-agent systems



---

9. Future Extensions

Planned expansions:

bandwidth class definitions

celestial memory zones

LFSL symbolic ontology

persona realm mapping

cosmic registry for agent spawning

starmap validators

epoch cross-referencing schemas
