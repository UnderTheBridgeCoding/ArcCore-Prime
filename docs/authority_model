We will do this the same way:

define the model

state the invariants

avoid implementation

make it impossible to misunderstand later

This will slot cleanly into a second doc, or the second half of SENTINEL_MODEL.md. I’ll write it as a drop-in section so you can decide placement.

🔑 Loop 3.2 — Authority Binding

ArcCore-Prime Governance Model

Purpose

Authority Binding defines how authority levels are assigned, compared, and enforced within ArcCore.

If Loop 3.1 defines how actions are judged,
Loop 3.2 defines who is allowed to exercise which actions.

This model exists to prevent:

accidental override of high-gravity memory

low-context actions mutating high-context structures

silent privilege escalation over time

Core Principle

Authority is contextual, not personal.

Authority in ArcCore is not a user trait.
It is a property of context, role, and memory gravity.

Sources of Authority

Authority may be derived from multiple bindings, but is always resolved to a single numeric value at judgment time.

Canonical Sources

Actor Authority

Node Authority

Cycle Authority

Sigil Authority

System Authority

Not all sources apply to every operation.

1️⃣ Actor Authority

Actor Authority represents the authority level of the entity attempting an action.

Examples of actors:

user

LLM session

automated process

recovery routine

Actor authority is:

explicit

numeric

non-escalating by default

Actor authority does not increase automatically through activity.

2️⃣ Node Authority

Each memory node may carry an authority requirement.

Node authority reflects:

importance

fragility

irreversibility

semantic weight

Examples:

low-priority notes → low authority

sigil-anchored conclusions → high authority

governance decisions → very high authority

Node authority acts as a floor:

An action targeting a node must meet or exceed the node’s authority.

3️⃣ Cycle Authority

Cycles represent temporal and conceptual layers of work.

Higher cycles generally imply:

more synthesis

more dependency

more downstream impact

Cycle authority:

may scale with cycle number

may be nonlinear

is resolved explicitly at judgment time

A low-cycle actor cannot override a high-cycle node without sufficient authority.

4️⃣ Sigil Authority

Sigils represent density and intent.

Applying a sigil:

increases the gravity of memory

raises the authority required to alter it

marks the node as an anchor point

Sigil authority rules:

sigil application requires MARK authority

sigil removal requires ≥ the authority that applied it

sigil-anchored nodes resist compression and deletion

Sigils do not guarantee permanence.
They guarantee respect.

5️⃣ System Authority

System authority represents non-user governance.

Used for:

recovery

integrity repair

migrations

trusted maintenance routines

System authority is:

explicit

limited in scope

auditable

System authority should be rare and visible.

Authority Resolution

At judgment time, the Sentinel resolves authority as follows:

Determine the OperationType

Identify the target node(s) (if any)

Compute the required authority:

max(node authority, cycle authority, sigil authority)

Compare against actor authority

Emit a GateResult

There is no implicit escalation.

Authority Invariants
Invariant 1 — No downward mutation

Lower-authority actors cannot mutate higher-authority memory.

Invariant 2 — MARK < GOVERN

MARK operations may never override GOVERN authority.

Invariant 3 — Authority is monotonic

Authority comparisons are numeric and ordered.

No symbolic roles.
No implicit trust.

Invariant 4 — Authority must be explainable

Every authority decision must be traceable to explicit bindings.

Authority and Compression

Compression level interacts with authority:

RAW → lowest resistance

SUMMARY → moderate resistance

SEED → elevated resistance

SIGIL_ONLY → highest resistance

Compression escalation requires MARK or GOVERN authority, depending on direction.

Non-Goals (Explicit)

Authority Binding does not:

assign default numeric values

define UI or user controls

automate escalation

override user autonomy

Those choices remain configurable.

Closing Statement

Authority Binding ensures that importance accumulates weight, not fragility.

High-gravity memory should be:

harder to erase

harder to distort

easier to explain

This is how ArcCore protects meaning over time.
