Welcome to acOS

acOS is a system designed to help you think without losing momentum.

It protects important work from interruptions, context loss, and resets — while staying lightweight, private, and honest about its limits.

You don’t need to manage memory manually.
You just need to work.

How Memory Works (In Plain Terms)

acOS focuses on meaning, not raw exhaust.

Recent, important work stays readily available

Older context gradually becomes lighter

Nothing important disappears silently

If something mattered, acOS leaves a recoverable trace.

The Active Window

When you’re actively working, acOS automatically protects context so you don’t have to re-explain yourself.

Important work remains accessible for several days

This window flexes based on what you’re doing

You don’t need to watch the clock

Think of this as continuity protection, not storage.

Sigils: Marking What Matters

If something feels important, you can place a sigil.

A sigil tells acOS:

“This matters. Don’t let it slip.”

Sigils:

strengthen short-term continuity

act as durable anchors later

help acOS reconstruct decisions when you ask

Sigils are powerful — and intentional.

They don’t mean “remember forever.”
They mean “leave a trail I can follow.”

What Happens Over Time

acOS does not hoard memory.

As time passes:

details may compress

summaries replace raw text

anchors remain

This keeps the system fast and reliable — without erasing meaning.

If nothing replaces old context, it may still be there.
That’s coincidence, not a promise.

Asking for Recall

You can always ask acOS to help you reconstruct important context.

Examples:

“Can you reconstruct the sigiled decision about X?”

“Do a sigil sweep and remind me what we concluded last month.”

Reconstruction focuses on outcomes and reasoning, not verbatim replay.

What acOS Does Not Promise

acOS is honest by design.

It does not promise:

infinite memory

perfect recall

permanent raw transcripts

automatic resurrection of everything

What it does promise:

continuity while you’re working

recoverable meaning afterward

transparency about limits

In One Sentence

acOS protects active thinking and preserves what mattered — without pretending memory is infinite.

You’re in control.
acOS is here to keep you moving.
